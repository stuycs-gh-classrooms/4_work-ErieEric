 # Breakout/Arkanoid
 ## 1) What is the purpose of the game?
 Destroy the blocks using a ball that bounces off a paddle.
    
 ## 2) What element(s) are controlled by the player?
 The x-direction of the paddle. 
 
 ## 3) What element(s) are controlled by the computer?
  The number of blocks, color, and whether the blocks have been hit or not.
  
 ## 4) How does the player control their element.
  The player controls the x-coordiante of the paddle using their mouse.
  
##  5) How do the non-player controlled elements behave (movement, positions, randomness, etc)?
 The color of blocks and starting position are random. Additionally, the speed of the ball is set by the computer.
  
## 6) If you were to program this, what classes would you write?
A paddle class, a ball class, and a block class. 

## 7) If you were to program this, would you use an array for some parts? What kind of array? What would you be storing in it?
I would create a 2d array to create the blocks. I would store the blocks data such as size and color. 

# Space Invaders
## 1) What is the purpose of the game?
Destroy all invaders using a ship before the invaders kill the player.
    
## 2) What element(s) are controlled by the player?
The movement of the ship and the bullets fired.

## 3) What element(s) are controlled by the computer?
The invaders' shot timing.

## 4) How does the player control their element.
The left and right arrow keys change direction of the ship. The space bar fires a bullet. 
    
## 5) How do the non-player controlled elements behave (movement, positions, randomness, etc)?
The invaders fire and move based on intervals set by the computer. 

## 6) If you were to program this, what classes would you write?
An inavder class and a ship class, ship bullet class, invader bullet class.

## 7) If you were to program this, would you use an array for some parts? What kind of array? What would you be storing in it?
I would utilize a 2d array for the inavders. I may possibly use an array for the bullets as well if I want to deploy multiple bullets at once.
